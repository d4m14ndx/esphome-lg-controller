# LG Protocol Feature Coverage

The table below compares the protocol features described in [`protocol.md`](protocol.md) with what the ESPHome controller currently implements in `esphome/components/lg_controller/lg-controller.h`.

| Protocol area | Implemented? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type 0 status: on/off, mode (cool/heat/dry/fan/auto), fan speeds (low/med/high/auto/quiet), swing (vertical/horizontal/both), purifier, target temperature with 0.5°C, Fahrenheit mapping, internal vs external thermistor, sleep timer (type 3), up to eight zones, HA-visible sensors for defrost/preheat/outdoor/error | ✅ | Status frames are built from climate state and pending flags, including purifier and swing bits, temp conversions, sleep timer encoding, and zone bitfields, while reporting unit-sent defrost/preheat/outdoor/error fields to HA. |
| Type 0 status: filter indicator, humidifier, resistive heater, swirl, energy saving, external ventilation, plasma sign blink, installer ceiling height/thermistor bits beyond selection, reservation types other than sleep timer, Fahrenheit toggle via byte 10 | ❌ | These bits are preserved from the last received frame but never interpreted, published, or set by the controller. |
| Type 1 capabilities: operation/fan/swing mode exposure, purifier, vane count, auto-dry, installer fan-curve exposure, overheating select, zone count inference | ✅ | Capabilities frames are stored in NVS and used to shape HA traits, hide unsupported entities (vanes, purifier, auto dry, installer fan speeds, overheating), and infer 4 vs 8 zone availability. |
| Type 1 capabilities: extra airflow, ESP/static pressure settings, half-degree support flag, energy usage/DRED/WiFi/AP/overcooling/leak detection/himalaya/mosquito/comfort/hum+e and other installer flags | ❌ | The code does not parse these capability bits or surface related entities/settings. |
| Type 2 settings (0xAA/0xCA): installer fan speeds (slow–high), vane positions (up to 4), auto-dry enable, mirroring min/max limits sent by unit | ✅ | The controller mirrors the last `0xCA/0xAA` frame, patches fan-curve overrides, vane positions, and the auto-dry flag, and resends them when changed. |
| Type 2 settings: power fan curve, auto-change temperature, auxiliary heater, dry contact/zone state flags, robot clean, explicit min/max setpoint overrides | ❌ | These bytes are copied through unchanged; there is no UI exposure or logic to adjust them. |
| Type 3 settings (0xAB/0xCB): overheating installer setting, pipe temperature sensors, zone-count byte, periodic CB requests | ✅ | Overheating is exposed as a select, pipe temps are decoded to sensors, zone count is honored, and periodic `0xAB` requests refresh `0xCB` data. |
| Type 3 settings: DRED modes, emergency heater options, centrigrade control, AP mode, model info, static pressure steps, leak detector, fan operation flags | ❌ | These fields are neither parsed nor controllable; values are only mirrored when echoing the last message. |
| Types 4–7 (extended status, advanced/extended installer settings, power/energy telemetry) | ❌ | The message dispatcher handles only types 0–3; newer status/installer frames are ignored and never sent. |
